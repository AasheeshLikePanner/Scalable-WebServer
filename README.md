# Scalable WebServer

A robust, high-performance Java-based web server designed to efficiently manage **60k+ concurrent requests**. This project showcases multiple server architectures with different threading models, including **Single-Threaded**, **Multi-Threaded**, and **Thread Pool** implementations, to ensure scalability and optimal performance.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Server Architectures**:
  - **Single-Threaded Server**: Sequentially handles one client request at a time, suitable for light workloads.
  - **Multi-Threaded Server**: Manages multiple client connections concurrently, allowing for higher throughput.
  - **Thread Pool Server**: Uses a fixed-size pool of threads, balancing resource management and concurrency for optimal performance under heavy load.

- **High Performance**:
  - Capable of managing **60k+ concurrent requests**.
  - Processes approximately **194 requests per second** across different load scenarios.
  - Achieves sub-millisecond response times for 90% of requests, even under heavy load.

- **Efficient Data Handling**:
  - **Data Received**: ~4.8 MB (averaging 160 kB/s).
  - **Data Sent**: ~528 kB (17 kB/s).
  - Zero failed requests across all test runs, indicating high reliability and stability.

- **Content Delivery**:
  - Serves static files like **HTML and CSS** with verification.
  - Ensures status 200 for content delivery.
  - Validates that CSS files include essential selectors, such as `body`, for consistency in front-end display.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics

### Load Testing Overview

We conducted load testing using **100 Virtual Users (VUs)** over a **30-second test duration** with a graceful stop period of 30 seconds. Results across different runs consistently showed high performance and stability.
