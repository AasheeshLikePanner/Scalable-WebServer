# WebServers

A high-performance Java-based web server capable of handling **60k+ concurrent requests**. It simulates a real-world web server with multi-threaded handling, supporting the delivery of **HTML** and **CSS** content. This project demonstrates different server architectures including **Single-Threaded**, **Multi-Threaded**, and **Thread Pool** servers, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.

## Features
- **Single-Threaded Server**: Handles one request at a time, simulating a simple server setup.
- **Multi-Threaded Server**: Efficiently manages multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **Thread Pool Server**: Uses a fixed-size thread pool to handle client requests, providing better resource management.
- **High Scalability**: Handles **60k+ requests** with ease, providing fast and efficient response times.
- **Caching**: Reduces server load and improves response time by storing frequently accessed content.
- **Real-World Web Server Simulation**: Can serve **HTML** and **CSS** files just like a real DNS browser-based server.

## What It Does
- Simulates the behavior of a real web server.
- Accepts HTTP requests from clients and serves HTML and CSS content.
- Efficiently handles a high volume of requests, ensuring optimal performance even under heavy load.

## Praise
- Built to scale: Handles up to **60,000+ requests** simultaneously.
- Delivers content like a real web server: Clients can request **HTML** and **CSS** files, mimicking a live website experience.

This project demonstrates key server-side concepts with the ability to handle thousands of requests, making it perfect for learning and experimentation in web server architecture.
